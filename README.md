PUNCH WORDPRESS BOOTSTRAP
===================

Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com) in WordPress theme form. 

Used Eddie Machado's Bones for a starting point (https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones) but it doesn't look too much like it any longer. 

FEATURES
________

We’ve built the WP Bootstrap theme so that it could be used as-is as a very basic theme or as a starting point for theme developers.
It’s built on top of the Bones theme framework by Eddie Machado and based on v3.1.0 of Bootstrap.

    - Page with left sidebar
    - Full width page
